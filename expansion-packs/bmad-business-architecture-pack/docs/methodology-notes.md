# Business Architecture Discovery Methodology Notes

## Guiding Principles

1. **Evidence before ideas** – Ground every recommendation in observed process, data, or
   stakeholder evidence.
2. **Traceability** – Maintain IDs across value streams, capabilities, use cases, problems,
   and opportunities to enable downstream analytics.
3. **Collaborative validation** – Co-create models with SMEs; build review loops into every
   workflow step.
4. **Information-first** – Treat data objects and lifecycle governance as core assets, not
   afterthoughts.

## Recommended Cadence

- **Day 1–2**: Domain Discovery (desk research, stakeholder mapping).
- **Day 3–4**: Value Stream mapping sessions + capability derivation.
- **Day 5**: Use case drafting, information modeling workshops.
- **Day 6**: Glossary refinement, problem register synthesis.
- **Day 7**: Opportunity clustering & value proposition workshop.
- **Day 8**: Executive alignment and Analyst Agent hand-off.

## Tooling Tips

- Capture interviews in collaborative docs; tag insights with capability/use case IDs.
- Store YAML artifacts in version control for auditability.
- Use the maturity scale consistently across capabilities and data stewardship.
- Maintain a rolling validation log to track unresolved assumptions.
