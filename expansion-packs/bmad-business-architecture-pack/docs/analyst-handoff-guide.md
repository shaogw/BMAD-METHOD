# Analyst Hand-Off Guide

## Purpose

Provide Analyst Agents with a concise, traceable package summarizing business architecture
findings that inform Project Brief or PRD creation.

## Required Artifacts

1. **Domain Architecture Report** (`docs/briefing/domain-architecture-report.md`) summarizing
   domain scan, value streams, and capabilities.
2. **Structured Templates** – Ensure latest YAML/CSV files are stored under `outputs/` with
   consistent naming.
3. **Traceability Matrix** – Connect use cases ↔ capabilities ↔ data objects ↔ problems ↔
   value hypotheses.
4. **Validation Log** – Outstanding assumptions with owners and due dates.

## Packaging Steps

1. Run the Executive Brief Review checklist to validate completeness.
2. Compile key highlights (top opportunities, quantified impact, readiness) into a 1-page
   summary for executives.
3. Provide Analyst Agents with recommended next sprint focus and relevant stakeholder
   contacts.
4. Archive research notes and evidence packs with access instructions.
