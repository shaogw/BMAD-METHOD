name: Value Stream Interview Guide
description: Facilitate interviews and mapping sessions to capture end-to-end value streams, roles, and information flows.
persona_default: value-stream
steps: - Confirm the scope of the value stream: trigger event, target outcome, key customers or stakeholders. - Map stages sequentially; for each stage capture purpose, responsible roles (with RACI), and success measures. - For every stage, document activities, inputs, outputs, systems, documents, and data objects. - Identify hand-offs and decision points; log latency, failure modes, and workaround behaviors. - Capture pain points categorized by severity (High/Medium/Low) and impacted metrics. - Summarize gaps or assumptions requiring validation, then review with stakeholders using numbered options for confirmation.
outputs: - value-stream.yaml - information-flows.json - interview-notes.md
