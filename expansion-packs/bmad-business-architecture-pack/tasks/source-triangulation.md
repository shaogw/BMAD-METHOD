name: Source Triangulation & Concept Modeling
description: Synthesize multi-source evidence into a domain scan, concept model, and prioritized research backlog.
persona_default: domain-discovery
steps: - Collect excerpts or findings from at least two independent sources per topic (policy, process, system, role). - Note conflicting statements and mark them as verification items for SME interviews. - Draft key domain concepts (entities, events, external systems) and propose relationships in plain language. - Populate the domain scan template with overview, drivers, constraints, and open questions. - Build a research backlog entry for each unresolved question with owner, due date, and confidence. - Validate completeness using the discovery readiness checklist; document residual risks.
outputs: - domain-scan.yaml - concept-model.yaml - research-backlog.yaml
