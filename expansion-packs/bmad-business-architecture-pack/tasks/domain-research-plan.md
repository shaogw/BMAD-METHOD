name: Domain Research Plan
description: Structure the discovery backlog, evidence sources, and interview cadence for a new business domain.
persona_default: domain-discovery
steps: - Review the engagement brief and summarize scope assumptions, known systems, and target stakeholders. - Inventory available sources (policies, contracts, SOPs, tooling docs) and rate their authority (High/Medium/Low). - Draft research objectives framed as questions; ensure coverage across business drivers, process scope, roles, and data. - Design a multi-channel research plan (desk, interview, system audit) with owners, timeboxes, and expected outputs. - Surface dependency risks, access needs, and compliance approvals required before research can begin. - Present the plan for confirmation using numbered options (1=approve, 2=revise scope, 3=adjust timeline, 4=add stakeholders).
outputs: - discovery-plan.md - research-backlog.yaml
