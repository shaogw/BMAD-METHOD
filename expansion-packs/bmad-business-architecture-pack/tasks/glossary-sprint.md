name: Glossary Sprint
description: Build and validate the engagement glossary, role catalog, and document taxonomy.
persona_default: glossary
steps: - Aggregate candidate terms from domain scan, value streams, use cases, and data models. - For each term, draft definition, category (Role, Document, Metric, Process, System), synonyms, and source references. - Capture role profiles (responsibilities, decision rights, information needs, pain points) leveraging archetype data. - Document key document types with purpose, owner, frequency, retention, and compliance basis. - Highlight conflicting or duplicate terminology; propose resolution or escalation path. - Present glossary updates for approval using numbered options (1=accept, 2=edit, 3=defer, 4=flag conflict).
outputs: - glossary.yaml - role-catalog.md - document-types.csv
