# Google Design Sprint Lab – Expansion Pack Brief

<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->

## Executive summary

The Google Design Sprint Lab equips product squads with AI co-pilots that mirror the
classic GV sprint methodology. Six specialized agents collaborate across Understand,
Diverge, Decide, Prototype, and Test to deliver validated product insights in five days.
The pack automates sprint logistics, enforces best practices, and accelerates critical
product decisions without diluting human creativity.

## Problem statement

Cross-functional teams struggle to maintain sprint discipline: agendas slip, How Might We
notes disappear, prototyping scope balloons, and Friday tests ship without a clear script.
Existing AI assistants lack the structured rituals and guardrails required by the sprint
playbook. Teams need a repeatable, guided environment that preserves the magic of a design
sprint while absorbing the administrative overhead.

## Target users

- Product managers and founders running discovery sprints for new value propositions.
- UX researchers who need consistent interview capture, HMW synthesis, and test reporting.
- Designers and engineers that must align on prototype scope and execution in one day.
- Innovation and venture studio leaders standing up sprint programs at scale.

## Goals and success metrics

- **Time-to-insight** – Reduce cycle time from challenge framing to validated concept.
- **Sprint completeness** – Ensure 100% coverage of required rituals, templates, and QA
  gates.
- **Decision clarity** – Produce artifacts that clearly articulate sprint questions,
  prototype rationale, and test outcomes.
- **Team adoption** – Enable cross-functional squads to activate the pack with minimal
  onboarding and sustain usage across multiple sprints.

## Solution overview

The pack delivers:

- Six personas calibrated for sprint duties with full command sets and dependencies.
- Executable tasks that implement interviews, clustering, Crazy Eights, storyboard builds,
  prototype stand-ups, and test debriefs with mandatory elicitation prompts.
- YAML templates and checklists that align with the GV sprint cadence.
- Reference data assets for agendas, prompts, tooling, and decision frameworks.
- Three workflows: full five-day sprint, lite validation sprint, and reusable test day.
- An agent team bundle so squads can launch the program with a single command.

## Roadmap

- **v1.1** – Add integration hooks for remote whiteboarding platforms and scheduling APIs.
- **v1.2** – Introduce analytics dashboards summarizing sprint throughput and learning
  velocity.
- **v1.3** – Expand agent set with prototyping specialists for hardware and service design.

## Dependencies

- Requires BMAD Core ≥ 1.4.0.
- Compatible with the BMAD CLI for workflow execution and agent activation.

## Maintainers

Authored by BMAD contributors with feedback from design sprint facilitators across product
startups and enterprise innovation teams.
