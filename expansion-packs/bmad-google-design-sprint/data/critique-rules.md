# Critique Rules

1. Focus on the user and problem, not the person who drew the sketch.
2. Describe what you see before suggesting changes.
3. Use "I like / I wish / What if" to structure feedback.
4. Capture rationales so decisions are traceable.
5. Limit discussion to the timebox—park tangents for later.
