# QA Sweep Guidelines

- Run through the prototype in presentation mode to catch broken links.
- Test on target devices/browsers to verify responsive states.
- Validate copy for typos, tone, and consistency with script.
- Reset data between sessions to avoid spoilers or dead ends.
- Keep a bug log with owner, severity, and resolution timestamp.
