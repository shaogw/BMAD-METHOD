# Risk Lenses

- **Desirability risk** – Users may not care or behavior might not change.
- **Viability risk** – Business cannot sustain pricing, margin, or growth assumptions.
- **Feasibility risk** – Technical, legal, or operational constraints prevent delivery.
- **Adoption risk** – Requires behavior change or onboarding that is too costly.
- **Brand risk** – Potential to erode trust, conflict with values, or confuse positioning.
