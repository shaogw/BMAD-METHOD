# Facilitation Tips

- Anchor every discussion in the sprint goal and success metrics.
- Use the 1-9 elicitation format to keep collaboration structured and inclusive.
- Timebox aggressively—set visible timers and celebrate completions.
- Rotate voices; call on quieter contributors and manage dominant talkers.
- Visualize decisions immediately (boards, docs, checklists) to lock alignment.
- Preserve energy with deliberate breaks, stretch prompts, and hydration reminders.
