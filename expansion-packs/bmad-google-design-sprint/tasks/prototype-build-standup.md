- During each checkpoint, invite every owner to report status, blockers, and next milestone; summarize updates with rationale, capture actions, and use the 1-9 elicitation menu to prioritize unblockers or adjust the plan.
- Maintain a visible Kanban of frames and statuses, escalating critical blockers to the decider or stakeholders as needed.
- Close with readiness confirmation and the QA plan for test day, then save notes to `prototype-standup-log.md`.
