name: Prototype Scope Plan
description: Define prototype goals, fidelity, responsibilities, and tooling before build day kicks off.
persona_default: prototype-lead
steps:

- Review storyboard frames and Friday learning objectives to align on what must be validated.
- Draft the prototype vision, including desired fidelity, guardrails, and success criteria, and confirm alignment using the 1-9 elicitation format.
- For each storyboard frame, assign an owner, supporting assets, and build considerations, presenting rationale and eliciting adjustments via the mandatory 1-9 protocol.
- Outline the tooling stack, integration points, and risk mitigations while flagging dependencies or approvals to secure.
- Define checkpoints for the build-day stand-ups, document open dependencies, and save the final plan to `prototype-plan.md` or via the template.

outputs:

- prototype-plan.md
