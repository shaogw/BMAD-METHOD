name: Sketch Critique
description: Facilitate structured critique of solution sketches prior to selection.
persona_default: solution-sketch-coach
steps:

- Remind the team of critique rules (focus on user impact, stay constructive, avoid personal comments) and confirm understanding with the 1-9 elicitation protocol.
- For each sketch, present key moments, strengths, and open questions neutrally, then capture feedback rounds (I Like, I Wish, What If) while using the numbered 1-9 menu to decide how to iterate.
- Record improvements, clarifications, and remix opportunities surfaced during critique.
- Summarize each sketch’s readiness for selection along with any follow-up tasks or prototypes to explore.
- Save critique outcomes to `sketch-critique-notes.md`.

outputs:

- sketch-critique-notes.md
