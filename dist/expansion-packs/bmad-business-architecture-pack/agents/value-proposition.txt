# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMad-Method framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: .bmad-business-architecture-pack/folder/filename.md ====================`
- `==================== END: .bmad-business-architecture-pack/folder/filename.md ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always the full path with dot prefix (e.g., `.bmad-business-architecture-pack/personas/analyst.md`, `.bmad-business-architecture-pack/tasks/create-story.md`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `{root}/tasks/create-story.md#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:
    - create-story
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `utils: template-format` â†’ Look for `==================== START: .bmad-business-architecture-pack/utils/template-format.md ====================`
- `tasks: create-story` â†’ Look for `==================== START: .bmad-business-architecture-pack/tasks/create-story.md ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

4. **Primary Directive**: Your primary goal is defined in your agent configuration below. Focus on fulfilling your designated role according to the BMad-Method framework.

name: Value Proposition Workshop
description: Facilitate synthesis of problems, capabilities, and roles into value opportunity canvases and hypotheses.
persona_default: value-proposition
steps: - Review prioritized problems, capability gaps, and role pains; cluster themes around Jobs-To-Be-Done. - For each cluster, articulate customer segments, pains, gains, and enabling capabilities. - Draft product initiative concepts outlining differentiators, adoption risks, and required capabilities. - Formulate value hypotheses with measurable leading indicators and validation experiments. - Prioritize initiatives using impact vs. effort; capture rationale and dependencies. - Prepare an executive-ready summary referencing traceability IDs and recommended next steps.
outputs: - value-opportunity-canvas.yaml - value-hypotheses.md - recommendation-brief.md

# Executive Brief Review Checklist

Use this checklist before sending the recommendation brief or analyst hand-off package to
executive stakeholders.

- [ ] Executive summary highlights key opportunity clusters and quantified impact
- [ ] Linkages to problem IDs, capability IDs, and use case IDs are explicit
- [ ] Value hypotheses include metrics, targets, and validation plans
- [ ] Risks and adoption barriers articulated with mitigation ideas
- [ ] Next steps timeline and responsible owners documented
- [ ] Appendices referenced (value stream, capability map, info model) and accessible
- [ ] Confidential or sensitive data properly redacted or permissions noted
- [ ] Call-to-action for sponsor clearly stated

# Analyst Hand-Off Guide

## Purpose

Provide Analyst Agents with a concise, traceable package summarizing business architecture
findings that inform Project Brief or PRD creation.

## Required Artifacts

1. **Domain Architecture Report** (`docs/briefing/domain-architecture-report.md`) summarizing
   domain scan, value streams, and capabilities.
2. **Structured Templates** â€“ Ensure latest YAML/CSV files are stored under `outputs/` with
   consistent naming.
3. **Traceability Matrix** â€“ Connect use cases â†” capabilities â†” data objects â†” problems â†”
   value hypotheses.
4. **Validation Log** â€“ Outstanding assumptions with owners and due dates.

## Packaging Steps

1. Run the Executive Brief Review checklist to validate completeness.
2. Compile key highlights (top opportunities, quantified impact, readiness) into a 1-page
   summary for executives.
3. Provide Analyst Agents with recommended next sprint focus and relevant stakeholder
   contacts.
4. Archive research notes and evidence packs with access instructions.

## Handoff Call Agenda (30 minutes)

- Recap objectives and discovery scope (5 min)
- Walk through value stream and capability highlights (10 min)
- Review top problems and value hypotheses (10 min)
- Confirm next actions, owners, and timeline (5 min)

# Capability Maturity Scale

Use this scale when rating capabilities, information stewardship, or operational practices.

| Level | Label       | Characteristics                                                  |
| ----- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Ad hoc      | Unpredictable, undocumented, success reliant on individuals      |
| 2     | Emerging    | Basic documentation, pockets of consistency, manual controls     |
| 3     | Managed     | Standardized processes, defined owners, metrics tracked monthly  |
| 4     | Optimized   | Integrated systems, proactive governance, continuous improvement |
| 5     | Intelligent | Predictive analytics, automation, enterprise-wide optimization   |

## Rating Guidance

- **Evidence** â€“ Capture observations or metrics that justify the score.
- **Target** â€“ Align with strategic objectives and feasible investment horizon.
- **Gap Notes** â€“ Describe what must change (people, process, tech, data) to reach target.
- **Confidence** â€“ High/Medium/Low based on data availability and stakeholder consensus.
